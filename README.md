# Queersicht App

Queersicht is a beautifully designed iOS app created for the **LGBTIAQ*-Filmfestival**. It serves as a central hub for showcasing movies, events, and locations, allowing users to explore the festival's program, manage favorites, and access detailed information about screenings and venues.

This app is not only tailored for Queersicht but also serves as a **starter template** for developers looking to build apps for other festivals, events, or community-driven projects.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

   open Queersicht.xcodeproj

   ```

3\. Add your `GoogleService-Info.plist` file to the project.

4\. Install the custom fonts (*DMSerifDisplay-Regular.ttf* and *Lora-Regular.ttf*):

   - Drag and drop the font files into your Xcode project.

   - Ensure they are included in your target's "Copy Bundle Resources."

5\. Update the Firebase database structure:

   - Create collections for `movies`, `events`, `locations`, and `contentnotes`.

   - Refer to the codebase for the required structure of these collections.

## Usage

The app is designed to work seamlessly out of the box for a film festival but can be customized for:

- **Music Festivals**  

  Display artist lineups, set times, and venue details.

  Provide a detailed schedule, speaker bios, and location info.

### Customization Tips

- **Branding**: Update the color scheme and fonts in `Assets.xcassets` and `Font+Custom.swift`.

- **Data Models**: Modify the `Models.swift` file to match your Firebase database schema.

- **Views**: Customize the `ListView` and `DetailView` files for your specific use case.
